    "Before you start working on this tutorial, we do want to put this disclaimer out there — the exercises are created to give you an overview of the data analysis process you could expect to see in a Portlab project. Also, this tutorial strictly focuses on **data manipulation and visualization**, so we won't talk about more advanced methods, i.e., machine learning, in this tutorial yet. By no means does this tutorial cover everything you'll face throughout the project. That being said, we do expect you to have a good grasp of the essentials we touched on here, and hopefully, you'll feel more prepared to sign up for a Portlab project:)\n",

    "Start off the tutorial by scanning the data and reading the **problem statement**, then move on from **one scenario to another in numeric order**! Each scenario has a number of **tasks** that are split into a number of **subtasks**. You will also find **hints** and **tips** (unhide the hidden cells) that walk you through the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we did our best to prepare and proofread the materials, but please let us know if you spot anything erroneous, odd, unclear, or just anything you disagree with. Thank you, and hope y'all have fun and learn a few tricks from the exercises!"

This [article](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling) sums up what makes a good data story quite nicely. At the minimum, it should at least include:\n",

    "- **Background:** Who is involved? What is happening? Use some summary statistics and basic visualizations to carry out these points. For example: From this line chart, we can notice an uptick in default rates in recent months.\n",
    "- **Issue:** Why might this be happening? Create pivot tables and more comprehensive visualizations to point out trends in the data. Even better, you can use intermediate statistics, e.g., a logistic regression model to explain which variables are main contributors to default.\n",
    "- **Solution:** How might we resolve this? Building on our analysis, which aspects should we look to improve on? What are we doing well? If we were to make some adjustments, whom should we target?\n",

    "- **[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/):** FiveThirtyEight is a journalism website that has some of the most creative visualizations and data stories out there. Great site for some inspiration!\n",
    "- **[storytelling with data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog) (SWD):** SWD regularly publishes blog articles regarding data visualization and data storytelling.\n",
    "- **[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/):** The Pudding is another journalism site that produces creative, interaction-focused visual essays.\n",
    "- **[Kaggle EDA Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python/notebook):** Kaggle is probably the largest data science community, and you can also find and learn from other people's work.

However, you still have a lot ahead of you on your journey in data. Here are some suggestions on where to start:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programming (Python, R):** \n",
    "- **Statistics & Math:** Statistics, probability, and just math in general are essential for any data professional, and you should definitely take advantage of the courses available at U-M while you're here. Without utilizing statistics in some shape or form, we won't be able to dig deeper into the problem. In our scenario, for example, **[regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)** would be a powerful tool to better understand and explain the default rate spike. To design experiments and draw causal relationships, learning about **[hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing)** and a few **[statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference)** methods is a must. If we want to move one step further and predict defaults, **[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)** would be the way to go, which again, would require some basic knowledge of **[linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)**.\n",
    "- **Data Management (SQL):** SQL will be an essential tool in almost any data-related role, so you'll be in a good spot if you learn it early on! [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) is a personal favorite, because it's interactive and to the point. If you prefer videos over text, here is a [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-3/understanding-sql) on LinkedIn Learning you could consider taking.\n",
    "- **Data Visualization:** This [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datavisualization#syllabus) provides a general introduction on visualization theories. If you're looking to gain more hands-on experience, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20222) is a good place to get started.
