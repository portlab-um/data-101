# Portlab Data Essentials
## Data Manipulation & Visualization
The exercises are created to give you an overview of the data analysis process you could expect to see in a Portlab project. Also, this tutorial strictly focuses on data manipulation and visualization, so we won't talk about more advanced methods, i.e., machine learning, in this tutorial yet. By no means does this tutorial cover everything you'll face throughout the project. That being said, we do expect you to have a good grasp of the essentials we touched on here, and hopefully, you'll feel more prepared to sign up for a Portlab project:)
